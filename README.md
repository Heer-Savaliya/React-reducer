## ðŸ§  What is Redux?

**Redux** is a predictable state management library for JavaScript apps. It helps you manage the state of your application in a centralized place and ensures that the state behaves consistently.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Store**: The single source of truth. Holds the entire application state.
2. **Actions**: Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened.
3. **Reducers**: Pure functions that determine how the state changes based on actions.
4. **Dispatch**: A method to send actions to the store.
5. **Selector**: A way to read data from the state.
